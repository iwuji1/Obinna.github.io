# About Me

<div class="p-container">

I'm very much still trying to come up with proper professional title. It's a bit of a struggle because I find that I like different aspects of different fields but find that the given titles tend to isolate what I can do to that specific role.

</div>

### Let me give an examples:

1. Since September 2020 I've worked as a Data analyst for a media agency in London. I find working with data interesting because it illustrates problems/ trends and concepts in a very practical and tangible way. You know, how much water is left in the tank? 40%. Are we doing better this year than last year? Well in terms of revenue we've dropped by 20% etc. The one who really got me excited about using data was Hans Rosling. His Ted talk used data to paint the world in a much more positive light that what I had seen till date. I thought that's cool, I want to do work that!

2. When I was smaller, not gonna lie I thought I was amazing at giving speeches. I thought when it comes to being able to talk persuasively and emphatically I was your guy! I even won a poetry competition and got my poem published in a book "bust a rhymes". My english teacher thought otherwise though, I was terrible when it came to punctuation...still am TBH. But I still get a sort of excitement when writing, I love the idea of building a world or moving someone's emotions through my words, till today I still imagine myself giving speeches, inspiring people, making people feel things with my words! Not sure if I'm any good but through this blog I hope to get back to that cause honestly its fun.

3. And last but not least, I have a lot of energy! I've always loved performing in one shape or another. School plays and productions I'm there! MC events yes! General hype man at functions I can do that. Not really sure how to do that professionally but yeah can do!

<div class="p-container">
Essentially I'm on a quest to find work that allows my to combine different parts of myself and provide value aka get paid for it :D.
</div>

### Here are some projects I've been doing in order to explore that:

<h3 class="box-header text-left">My Youtube Channel</h3>
<p>I make explainer videos talking about different topics in relation to Africa.</p>
<p>From history to economics or honestly whatever I can think of. It's a bit weird that as much I identify as Nigerian I don't know that much about my country or those surrounding me.</p>
<p>This is an attempt to rectify that in a fun way. Thus the birth of the African Explainer :D </p>

<div class="flex-2-1 flex-child">
<h3 class="box-header text-left">Data Stories</h3>
<p>For most of my professional life(Which is not very long at this point), I have been a data analyst. I like how data and visuals can help better understandings of complex issues whether that relates to revenue or migration patterns. I want to create more data stories to illuminate things I find interesting so here is a catalogue of my work thus far!</p>

<div class="flex-2-1 flex-child">
<h3 class="box-header text-left">Daily Writing</h3>
<p>I am a self proclaimed writer/storyteller! A big part of that is having a daily practice of doing that writing/storytelling. Here is a catalogue of my writing. It varies from funny to serious, life stories to random musings; all important for me to develop this practice so that one day I can go from self proclaimed to actual. Hope you enjoy</p>

<div class="flex-2-1 flex-child">
<h3 class="box-header text-left">Afripple</h3>
<p>I talk alot! It's a hobby if I'm honest. A good chunk of that is asking questions both to google and actual people. When I first graduated from University a big question is how does life actually work for people like me. Afripple is a blog dedicated to the everyday stories of Africans living outside of their home country. If you are as curious as I am about about other people's business this could be a good resource for you</p>
