What I'm doing Now
{: .page-header-2}

I'm based in the UK right now, working as an analyst for a media agency, I'll also be attending a portfolio school in September! The goal right now is to narrow down my work as a creative. As such these are my current priorities:

<br>

1. Write more publicly/ improve my writing skills
2. Work on growing an online audience and improving marketing skills
3. Get stage experience, through performing constantly
4. Improve on video editing, through working on my Youtube channel
5. Create and ship more data stories about social issues.

<br>

If my activities or priorities happen to change, Iâ€™ll update this page to reflect those changes. Last update was July 18, 2021.
