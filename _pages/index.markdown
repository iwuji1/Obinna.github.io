<h3 class="box-header">Videos</h3>

<p>I make explainer videos talking about different topics in relation to Africa.</p>
<p>From history to economics or honestly whatever I can think of. It's a bit weird that as much I identify as Nigerian I don't know that much about my country or those surrounding me.</p>
<p>This is an attempt to rectify that in a fun way. Thus the birth of the African Explainer :D </p>

<h3 class="box-header">Data Stories</h3>

<p>For most of my professional life(Which is not very long at this point), I have been a data analyst. I like how data and visuals can help better understandings of complex issues whether that relates to revenue or migration patterns. I want to create more data stories to illuminate things I find interesting so here is a catalogue of my work thus far!</p>

<h3 class="box-header">Writing</h3>

<p>I am a self proclaimed writer/storyteller! A big part of that is having a daily practice of doing that writing/storytelling. Here is a catalogue of my writing. It varies from funny to serious, life stories to random musings; all important for me to develop this practice so that one day I can go from self proclaimed to actual. Hope you enjoy</p>

<h3 class="box-header">Afripple</h3>

<p>I talk alot! It's a hobby if I'm honest. A good chunk of that is asking questions both to google and actual people. When I first graduated from University a big question is how does life actually work for people like me. Afripple is a blog dedicated to the everyday stories of Africans living outside of their home country. If you are as curious as I am about about other people's business this could be a good resource for you</p>
