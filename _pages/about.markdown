##About Me
I'm very much still trying to come up with proper professional title. It's a bit of a struggle because I find that I like different aspects of different fields but find that the given titles tend to isolate what I can do to that specific role.

Let me give an examples:

Since September 2020 I've worked as a Data analyst for a media agency in London. I find working with data interesting because it illustrates problems/ trends and concepts in a very practical and tangible way. You know, how much water is left in the tank? 40%. Are we doing better this year than last year? Well in terms of revenue we've dropped by 20% etc.

The one who really got me excited about using data was Hans Rosling. His Ted talk used data to paint the world in a much more positive light that what I had seen till date. I thought that's cool, I want to do work that!

When I was smaller, not gonna lie I thought I was amazing at giving speeches. I thought when it comes to being able to talk persuasively and emphatically I was your guy! I even won a poetry competition and got my poem published in a book "bust a rhymes". My english teacher thought otherwise though, I was terrible when it came to punctuation...still am TBH. But I still get a sort of excitement when writing, I love the idea of building a world or moving someone's emotions through my words, till today I still imagine myself giving speeches, inspiring people, making people feel things with my words! Not sure if I'm any good but through this blog I hope to get back to that cause honestly its fun.

And last but not least, I have a lot of energy! I've always loved performing in one shape or another. School plays and productions I'm there! MC events yes! General hype man at functions I can do that. Not really sure how to do that professionally but yeah can do!

Essentially I'm on a quest to find work that allows my to combine different parts of myself and provide value aka get paid for it :D.

Here are some projects I've been doing in order to explore that:
