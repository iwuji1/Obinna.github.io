I have been through journey when it comes to my weight, one thing I have learnt is that no matter how hard you try no one will ever be satisfied with your weight, so you should just stop and make sure you are good enough for yourself.

When I was younger I was rather large, like I had man boobs and everything, it was said that I was one of the pioneers of twerking, cause I would walk my bum would just be jiggling. I would get made fun of because of it by friends and family and I felt bad but was too lazy to try working out, so I just did enough that I could play sports. That's right I was that over energetic fat kid running around over the game bumping people and dying of exhaustion afterwards . I kind of felt like mikey on that show recess, just instead of singing I liked acting and was overly persistent at sports.

Then I went to school in Nigeria for a couple years and found out all I need to lose some weight was a good dose of dust and unbearable heat. That’s right I sweated my breasts off!
The thing is, I’m very extreme with everything I do, when I act I really fall into the character, when I watch TV I binge for hours and when I lose weight I also get sick and get abit skinny. But I thought this would be great, before my mum would complain that I was too big now at least I had lost the weight, but no...I lost too much weight!

So now the issue was I was too skinny, truly there is no satisfying anyone. So I’m like okay now I’m too skinny I need to add some weight again to even some things out. So I eat more and do exercise here and there thinking it would make things better. But as some of you may know you cn’t always control what part of your body develop the way you want them, some how I had done this thing where my body is stll somewhat what slim but my chest specifically my nipples drop out. So even though I would say I was physically fit, I would get a mix of people saying I was too skinny and people pulling on my nipples. Its like I had inherited the worst of both worlds.

Things finally came to head when I first started dating someone and they were like you know I’m a bigger girl so you are going to have to get some muscle to fit. That was the last straw! No you know what, I’m happy I’m fit enough that if someone was chasing I’m fast enough and have enough endurance to get away from them for a while. I’m strong enough, that if I was hanging from the edge of a ledge I can do a nathan drake and pull myself up. I may not have the packs, or defined muscles of your average african mix of good genes but that is what baggy shirts are for okay! Hides the nipples whilst still looking good.
