I’ve always been a very touchy feely type of person. I’m very much in touch with my emotions and tend to really dive deep into how I am feeling at a time. This can be both good and bad as when I’m on a high, I am on a real high but when I’m low I tend to spiral.

Growing up though I never really found many outlets to release what I was feeling. My life was school then home, so whilst I had “friends” most were more school friends than people I could really be close to. And of course though my mum was and is amazing, there is a limit to how much you can really open to a parent. So it was kind of weird the one person who I could really open up to, wasn’t really available.

So I found when I was feeling a lot of things, I would retreat to my imagination. That’s right I was that kind of kid, I could stare off into space for hours, building a world in my head, building scenarios where I could express what I wanted through a huge dramatic speech, but in my head. I could have fantastic encounters with amazing people, but in my head. Where life was an adventure and I was the main hero with my own powers and the personality I wish I had...again in my head.

For people like me creative outlets I find are essential! Which is why I loved drama class, because in that class I was whoever. I could do whatever, I can get as crazy as a character demands or as reserved as is necessary. I could turn off my brain and just fall into whoever I was at that time, it was a proper escape. I also found however, that I wanted to also express my feelings and so I tried poetry. In my mind I was pretty good, because at least to me every word I wrote was truth and was impactful! Looking back I’m pretty sure my poems were absolute nonsense but hey it is what it is. I actually got a poem published, which surprised me because it was based off an episode of One piece an anime I loved. It talked about the blooming of cherry blossoms in the snow, cause I was watching the drum Island arc. I remember reading the poem out during a school assembly and thinking to myself “Are these guys really serious? Cause I was kinda bullshiting when writing this(though using whatever word 12 year old me meant for bullshit”.

I recently was supporting my friend as she did a poetry reading for a small group of people, the poem was amazing, she really pulled me into her world, her thoughts, she was really talented. The thing I love about such creative mediums is their ability to really translate emotion and connection, I loved her poem because I felt the hurt she was talking about having someone she loved, fall out of love. I love acting because in that moment when I synchronize with how my character feels and I look out at the audience as they watch in attentive silence, I feel alive!

Poetry really is amazing! It was one of the first mediums I ever used to better understand myself, I love how word smiths paint a story that makes you feel, and how every time you read it you get something new. Poetry is amazing!
