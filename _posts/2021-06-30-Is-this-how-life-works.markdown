Okay let me explain.

You know when you are in school, no matter how long days are, or how much stuff you have to do, you push through because you know deep in your heart that one day...ONE DAY! This will all be over, and you’ll finally be able to enjoy this adventure we call life!

Yeah I felt that way too! But then I got out of school, I started working, and you know what, life kind of sucks! Now let me just say I am very grateful, many people don’t have any sort of job or stability in their lives. And there I was straight out of uni, with a good paying job and was somewhat stable...but still life sucks.

And it sucks because, after a while I realized my routine consisted of waking up, going to work, finishing work, driving home, feeling tired, eating dinner, watching some TV and going to sleep. And then wake up and do the same thing again! Aaahhhhh! Is this life?! It may have been an issue of me not liking that job, maybe that’s why I felt that way. But since then I’ve had another job, I’ve switched countries, and switched jobs again. And still the same thing! Plus with a pandemic, I can barely even leave the house, so now even the going home part is less interesting.

Honestly, I thought these days of young adulthood would be some of the most fun, because I’m old enough to have some freedom but still young enough to be a bit reckless with how I use it. Now people tell me I should just wait until I’m thirty and that’s when the true fun begins...no...just no. I refuse!

It is really hard for me to believe that this is it. All those years of grinding to just get a job and live the rest of your days going through the routine! Honestly, I do hope this is just a phase and I find something else on the side at least but damn, really. There must be more to life than this.
