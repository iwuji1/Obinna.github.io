A question I get asked every now and then is what type of Christian are you? Now you may be wondering, who on earth would ask you such a personal question? Who would be that nosey?

Well, people, I don’t really know, it just comes up in conversation randomly, I don’t keep track of these things, it just happens. Do you remember everyone who ever asked you an overly ambitious question, I don’t!

Anyway, back to the point, the question I was asked was what type of christian are you? My answer to this is that I am an adaptable Christian, not in the way you are thinking though. Not like one moment I’m in church, the next, then I walk down the street selling weed to the priest, yeah I’m not like the priest. More like, I am the christian of whatever household I’m in at the time.

And I’ve been in a couple of households. I grew up catholic with my hail Mary’s, I moved over to protestat with Hillsongs, I’ve done some anglican our father’s, moved back to protestant this time Naija style, I’ve also done some white people non-denominational and have even dabbled in Rasterfarian.

Now, this may sound like it must have confused me in my faith journey. But in my mind it has just opened the net to who I can husband! Honestly, if you are a Jehova’s witness I can come a knockin with you, if you are redeemed church of God I can sing hallelujah in unison in English, igbo, Yoruba and even Spanish, that’s right I went through a phase.

But I’ve noticed as confusing as this might sound, as a result of all of this, I have done what less than 30% of most of christian population have even attempted, that’s right I have actually read the bible...well I at least got through exodus, which was actually really aptly named.

But I don’t just study the bible I study religion in general, because as different as we all try to be, many faiths are very similar and revolve around the same principle beliefs. The main difference is execution. As a catholic you do the rosary, doing the hail Mary’s till you reach the big bead for an our farther, and found it funny how similar it is to Muslim prayers where they recite multiple versus of the Qu’ran before doing a big prayer. It’s all different ways essentially into their Nirvana zone. Okay that was a slight over exaggeration but you get my meaning.

One of the biggest clashes I see is that between Christians and Muslims. As if one is trying to snuff out the other. And it really makes no sense to me. I was having a long discuss and about the differences between christianity and Islam and I found it interesting how we were pointing differences between each other without actually knowing much about the other. We were a classic product of Chinese whispers, cause we have just heard a lot but never actually looked into it.

The conversation climaxed as we actually took time to read both the bible and Qu’ran and to both of our surprises both texts mention and validates the existence of the other belief. And Corroborate stories like Abraham and Isaac and Moses and Elijah. It was mad, now you must wondering wow you and this friend must be really devoted to understanding faith and pushing for this harmony between religions. Well yes….and no. We were trying to find an excuse to not feel guilty about dating. Yeah man, we were trying to smash, and tell people it was okay because the bible tells me so.
