I was talking to my mum a couple of weeks ago, she was at a gathering with relatives, and she was telling me about it. I would come my family to a blow pop lolli pop, as in at the center is the core family, the people who actually know and want to get to but to get there you need to lick through layers of excess family.

And they are good at times don’t get me wrong that’s why you go through the trouble of licking through them but you only really care about the center.

Anyway, she was telling me about this aunty who was asking about me, which was sweet , she was like do you remember aunty beep, she used to hold you when you were a baby”...first of all to tell you the truth, I don’t know which aunty you are talking about. I don’t the names of anyone of my aunties, they are all just called aunty cause there are far too many of them. At one time I did try to remember their names, but then I found out that not all my auntries are actually my relatives. Yeah cause in nigerian culture any adult who is aquatined with your parents are deemed aunty or uncle. Do you know how scary that is as young individual, you get close to someone feeling like family just to find out they were just some random who your mum met at the hair salon!

Mind blown! Life is a lie, is anyone truly my family? I was too scared to confront relatives I actually liked just to find out they were not actually family at all. But ignorance is bliss so I won’t ask everyone can just be aunty/uncle and that is all that is to be said. Sorry aunties and uncles who are watching this , I may not actually know you name, but I probably couldn’t pronounce it right anyway so its probably for the best.

Second, of course I don’t remember an aunty who held me when I was a baby. I had barely figured out my facial structure at that point, I was just a blob of nonsense flesh, life was hard I had no time to start remembering faces. Heck I was still trying to figure out this random person who kept trying to make me call her mum. It was a hard time. The bigger question is why does she remember me? DOes she go around remember all the babies she has carried? Being, like i’m going to go away for a couple of decades you better remember me when I return?

No I don’t remember you, and honestly I doubt you remember me that much,but for asking of me I will you do you the courtesy of pretending to remember you and send my love. Long time! See you in a couple years!

But honestly, I love being a part of a large family, it makes you feel part of something cause you know if anything happens there a couple people out there who will give just a bit more of a shit than other people on how you are doing. Its like getting a warm handshake, you are still cold but it’s pleasant to have.
